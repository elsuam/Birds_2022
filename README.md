# Birds_2022
Performed as a project for a class on Data Mining, this uses machine learning techniques in R to analyze data on over 10,000 bird species.  It is meant to briefly display SOME OF the skills learned in the class and will likely be looked back upon as a data scientist's "first steps."

*To be used as a template and revised in the future.*
